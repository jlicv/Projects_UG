	abstract = {This paper aims to explore links between the Indian stock market and three developed Asian markets (i.e. Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore) using cointegration methodologies in order to explore interdependence. We further estimate the time-varying conditional correlation relationships among these markets. We find that correlations rose dramatically during periods of crisis and return to their initial levels after the crisis. Finally, we investigated the presence of different volatility regime across stock markets. International investors may find useful to model their portfolio by also considering how volatile stock markets are. Results show that estimated probability of being in the low volatility state is the highest for all stock markets considered, as well as the probability to switch from a medium- to high-volatility state. Results suggest a short-run relationship and absence of a strong long-run relationship among these markets. Absence of long-run linkages among these markets may provide potential benefits for the investors that look at emerging markets to enhance their risk adjusted returns by including emerging markets in their portfolios.},

Because these patterns in average returns apparently are not explained by the CAPM, they are called anomalies. We find that, except for the continuation of short-term returns, the anomalies largely disappear in a three-factor model. Our results are consistent with rational ICAPM or APT asset pricing, but we also consider irrational pricing and data problems as possible explanations.},

Our point estimates are economically large, suggesting that input specificity is an important determinant of the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks in the economy.},

	abstract = {This thesis analyzes and models the flow of intermediate inputs across sectors by adopting a network perspective on sectoral interactions. I apply these tools to show how fluctuations in the aggregate economy can be obtained from independent shocks to individual sectors. First, by interpreting data in detailed input-use matrices through this lens, I characterize the structure of input trade in the U.S. On the demand side, a typical sector relies on a small number of key inputs and sectors are similar in this respect. However, in their role as input-suppliers sectors do differ: many specialized input suppliers coexist alongside general purpose sectors that function as hubs to the economy. The thesis then shows how to construct a network model of input-use matrices that can reproduce these connectivity features in the data. In a standard multisector setup, I use this model of input-use matrices to provide analytical expressions linking the variability in aggregates to the network structure of input trade. I show that the presence of sectoral hubs - by coupling production decisions across the economy - leads to fluctuations in aggregates. Furthermore, I show that this network approach provides a common framework for hitherto opposing arguments on how fast the volatility of aggregates decays with the number of sectoral technologies.},

First, we construct annual coexceedance probabilities for both lower and upper tail return quantiles using daily data from 1974–2006. Next, we explain these probabilities in a panel gravity model framework. Results show that macroeconomic variables asymmetrically impact stock market comovement across the return distribution. Financial liberalization significantly increases left tail comovement, whereas trade integration significantly increases comovement across all quantiles. Decreasing exchange rate volatility results in increasing lower tail comovement. The introduction of the euro increases comovement across the entire return distribution, thereby significantly reducing the benefits of portfolio diversification within the euro area.},

Finally, economy-wide merger waves are driven by merger activity in industries that are centrally located in the product market network.

Using the 1997 input-output trade flow data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to model the inter-industry network, they examine whether an industry's position in the network, in particular, its 'network centrality,' affects the transmission of information and economic shocks. They find that, compared to the accounting performance and stock returns of noncentral industries, those of central industries are explained by aggregate risks to a greater extent and are more highly associated with the contemporaneous and future performance of their linked industries. These findings suggest that network centrality matters-it plays an important role in how economic shocks are transmitted within the economy. The question of why network centrality matters, however, remains unanswered. A fruitful avenue for future research is to explore the origin of shocks to shed light on the fundamental question of whether sectoral shocks can aggregate into macro shocks.},

Using a sample of 12 Chinese sectors for the period of 2006-2014, we find that their conditional correlations with the S\&P500 index vary significantly across sectors and across the two crises, namely, the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2010-2011 European Debt Crisis. To provide an economic interpretation for the dynamic conditional correlations, we lean on the general equilibrium model, as suggested by Papanikolaou (2011), in which the heterogeneity of sector-level conditional correlations can be associated with the heterogeneous sensitivities to investment shocks. We finally verify our interpretation by investigating the relationship between sector-level conditional correlations and industry-specific investment opportunities. Our main finding is that investment opportunities, as proxied by book-to-market ratio, capital expenditure, long-term debt ratio, growth rate of industry size, and Tobin's Q, are significantly associated with the magnitude of the dynamic conditional correlations. This paper thereby advances our understanding of industry heterogeneities from the perspective of industries' responses to investment shocks.},

Building on the framework of Acemoglu et al. (2012), we argue that the economy's input-output structure can fundamentally reshape the distribution of aggregate output, increasing the likelihood of large downturns from infinitesimal to substantial. More specifically, we show that an economy with non-trivial intersectoral input-output linkages that is subject to thin-tailed productivity shocks may exhibit deep recessions as frequently as economies that are subject to heavy-tailed shocks. Moreover, we show that in the presence of input-output linkages, aggregate volatility is not necessarily a sufficient statistic for the likelihood of large downturns. Rather, depending on the shape of the distribution of the idiosyncratic shocks, different features of the economy's input-output network may be of first-order importance. Finally, our results establish that the effects of the economy's input-output structure and the nature of the idiosyncratic firm-level shocks on aggregate output are not separable, in the sense that the likelihood of large economic downturns is determined by the interplay between the two.},

In order to sustain and improve previous results regarding correlation analysis between stock market indices, namely FTSE100, DJIA30, Nikkei225 and Bovespa, we extend here such analysis using the Coherence Morlet Wavelet, considering financial crisis episodes. Results indicate that the relation among indices was strong but not homogeneous across scales, that local phenomenon's are more felt than others in these markets and that there seems to be no quick transmission through markets around the world, but yes a significant time delay. The relation among these indices has changed and evolved through time, mostly due to financial crisis that occurred at different time periods. Results also favor the view that geographically and economically closer markets exhibit higher correlation and more short run comovements among them. Strong comovement is mostly confined to long-run fluctuations favoring contagion analysis. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Because liquidity preference shocks are imperfectly correlated across regions, banks hold interregional claims on other banks to provide insurance against liquidity preference shocks. When there is no aggregate uncertainty, the first‐best allocation of risk sharing can be achieved. However, this arrangement is financially fragile. A small liquidity preference shock in one region can spread by contagion throughout the economy. The possibility of contagion depends strongly on the completeness of the structure of interregional claims. Complete claims structures are shown to be more robust than incomplete structures.},

	abstract = {We develop a microeconomic model of endogenous growth where clean and dirty technologies compete in production and innovation—in the sense that research can be directed to either clean or dirty technologies. If dirty technologies are more advanced to start with, the potential transition to clean technology can be difficult both because clean research must climb several rungs to catch up with dirty technology and because this gap discourages research effort directed towards clean technologies. Carbon taxes and research subsidies may nonetheless encourage production and innovation in clean technologies, though the transition will typically be slow. We characterize certain general properties of the transition path from dirty to clean technology. We then estimate the model using a combination of regression analysis on the relationship between R\&D and patents, and simulated method of moments using microdata on employment, production, R\&D, firm growth, entry and exit from the US energy sector. The model's quantitative implications match a range of moments not targeted in the estimation quite well. We then characterize the optimal policy path implied by the model and our estimates. Optimal policy makes heavy use of research subsidies as well as carbon taxes. We use the model to evaluate the welfare consequences of a range of alternative policies.},

Our specifications predict 16–20\% of the one-quarter-ahead variation in excess stock market returns, and exhibit stable and statistically significant out-of-sample forecasting power.

We show that financial contagion exhibits a form of phase transition as interbank connections increase: as long as the magnitude and the number of negative shocks affecting financial institutions are sufficiently small, more "complete" interbank claims enhance the stability of the system. However, beyond a certain point, such interconnections start to serve as a mechanism for propagation of shocks and lead to a more fragile financial system. We also show that, under natural contracting assumptions, financial networks that emerge in equilibrium may be socially inefficient due to the presence of a network externality: even though banks take the effects of their lending, risk-taking and failure on their immediate creditors into account, they do not internalize the consequences of their actions on the rest of the network.},

本文提出并验证了期铝和铝业上市公司股票之间的三个价格传导机制,即期铝价格变动经由期货市场对现铝的价格发现功能,股票市场板块效应和资金流在期市与股市之间流转这三个途径传递至股票市场的铝业板块和各铝业上市公司,最终期铝价格对铝业上市公司股价的影响是这三个传导机制综合作用的结果。
本文进一步运用协整理论、格兰杰因果关系检验、向量自回归模型、误差修正模型、脉冲响应函数、方差分解等函数方法,多角度地研究铝期货和铝业上市公司的股票价格指数之间的价格发现(领先滞后关系)。其研究结果发现期铝价格与铝业上市公司股指之间存在着长期共同的趋势;只存在期铝价格对铝业股票的单向引导关系;期铝价格变动在短时内领先于上游的铝业上市公司股价指数,而在较长的时间段内领先于下游的股价指数;期货市场对股票市场的价格发现功能中处于主导地位。期铝价格信息的纳入能提高对铝业上市公司股价的预测精度。另外,本文的实证结果还发现国内期铝和现铝之间存在双向引导关系,这与前人研究结果(只存在期铝对现铝的单向引导)有所不同。
通过商品期货价格与相关上市公司股票价格的内在关系的实证研究不但为企业、投资者和相关部门提供决策借鉴,而且还延伸期货价格发现功能链条至股票市场,加长了整体虚拟资本市场研究的链条。},

This offers a clean setting to test two credit contagion channels through which a financial firm's bankruptcy can affect other firms—“counterparty risk” and “information transmission” channels. Using market microstructure variables to measure the various dimensions of contagion effects, we provide robust evidence supporting the significance of counterparty risk. Firms with exposure to Lehman suffered more severe negative effects—wider bid-ask spread, higher price impact, greater information asymmetry, and greater selling pressure—than unexposed firms. We find mixed evidence regarding the information transmission hypothesis.},

We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of “cascade effects” whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the “sparseness” of the input–output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.},

B share returns exhibit little or no correlation with international stock index returns or returns on China-related stocks traded in Hong Kong and the United States. However, instruments for international risk premiums have some power to forecast B share returns. Discounts at which B shares trade relative to ‘A’ shares available to Chinese citizens are correlated across firms and related to similar premiums in other Asian markets. However, they exhibit little association with instruments for international risk premiums.

	abstract = {A lot of studies dealing with international correlations look only at correlations at the market level and often use its time-varying nature as motivation for their work. However, why and how market correlations change is a point that is still not very well understood. As the market is composed of different sectors, we propose to look into this question by studying the behavior of equity correlations at the sectoral level. We show how sectoral correlation coefficients determine the market correlation coefficient and decompose the latter into two parts; one that represents country factors and one that represents industry factors. This decomposition allows us to get a clear idea on how and why market correlations change over time. We also get some interesting insights such as market level correlations are higher on average than sectoral correlations as well as that sectoral correlations between countries tend to do be more stable over time than market level correlations and sectoral correlations within countries. Finally, we present evidence that a few sector correlations related to Financial, Industrial and Consumer Services segments drive the evolution of the market level correlation.},

The parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. A simulation study of this new model is conducted covering many scenarios. The simulation results show that the MLE method is efficient in estimating the model parameters. An empirical analysis is also provided, which focuses on the detection of financial crisis contagion between United States and some European Union countries during the period of sub-prime crisis from the angle of financial risk. The degree of financial contagion between markets is subsequently measured by utilizing the quantile regression coefficients. The empirical results show that in a crisis situation, the interdependence between United States and European Union countries dramatically increases.},

The properties of the resulting periodic dynamic conditional correlation (PDCC) model are examined, focusing particularly on stationarity and the implications for unconditional shock correlations. When applied to the intraweek interactions between six developed European stock markets and the United States over 1993–2005, we find very strong evidence of periodic conditional correlations for the shocks. The highest correlations are generally observed on Thursdays, with these sometimes being twice those on Monday or Tuesday. In addition to these PDCC effects, strong day-of-the-week effects are found in mean returns for the French, Italian, and Spanish stock markets, while periodic effects are also present in volatility for all stock markets except Italy.},

Opaque stocks with high R2s are also more likely to crash, that is, to deliver large negative returns. Using stock returns from 40 stock markets from 1990 to 2001, we find strong positive relations between R2 and several measures of opaqueness. These measures also explain the frequency of crashes.},

The idea is that "contagion" between markets occurs as the result of attempts by rational agents to infer information from price changes in other markets. This provides a channel through which a "mistake" in one market can be transmitted to other markets. Hourly stock price data from New York, Tokyo and London during an eight month period around the crash offer support for the contagion model. In addition, the magnitude of the contagion coefficients are found to increase with volatility.},

Using a multi-sector general equilibrium model, we show that the interplay of idiosyncratic microeconomic shocks and sectoral heterogeneity results in systematic departures in the likelihood of large economic downturns relative to what is implied by the normal distribution. Notably, we also show that such departures can happen while GDP is approximately normally distributed away from the tails, highlighting the qualitatively different behavior of large economic downturns from small or moderate fluctuations. We further demonstrate the special role that input-output linkages play in generating “tail comovements,” whereby large recessions involve not only significant GDP contractions, but also large simultaneous declines across a wide range of sectors.},

The correlations increased over time, particularly after their EU entry and largely remained at these levels during the financial crisis. The stock markets exhibit asymmetry in the conditional variances and to a certain extent in the conditional correlations as well, pointing to the importance of applying a sufficiently flexible econometric framework.

本文的主要工作和创新点如下:
(1)本文对Copula理论及其建模方法进行了系统的梳理和总结。介绍了Copula的概念、性质;条件Copula的一般形式;由Copula理论引出的相关性指标;以及Copula建模时的参数估计问题。
(2)引入了图论中藤方法为多元相关结构建模提供新思路,介绍了解决多元相关结构建模时正定性问题的方法,并利用藤研究了多元联合分布的分组分解。将Copula理论和藤理论结合起来,利用藤的迭代结构来层层递进,最终构建出多元相关结构模型,并讨论了多元变量联合分布利用藤理论进行分组分解的可行性,给出了Copula藤建模中的参数估计方法。此外,引入了相关信息等概念,它被用来解释藤理论对相关结构的描述。
(3)将藤理论和Copula理论结合应用于金融领域。对本文选取的四元汇率数据,首先对其对数收益率数据进行了基本统计量分析,接着进行了GARCH模型处理,利用Copula函数考虑其两两间的相关结构,并考察了不同的Copula函数对其间相关结构的拟合效果。在考察两两序列间的相关结构之后,利用藤理论,对对数收益率残差变量进行了多元建模,并同一般的Gaussian Copula多元建模进行了比较,此后,对藤Copula模型进行改进,不仅考虑了在同一藤上选取不同的Copula函数进行建模,还考虑利用不同的藤结构进行建模,并做了相应比较。实证过程不仅证明了用藤理论构建多元变量相关结构模型的有效性,还通过选择不同的藤结构和在每一层上选取不同的Copula函数进行建模显示出藤结构的灵活性。},

Our paper introduces a new multiple testing framework and provides historical cutoffs from the first empirical tests in 1967 to today. A new factor needs to clear a much higher hurdle, with a t-statistic greater than 3.0. We argue that most claimed research findings in financial economics are likely false.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic multi-agent model of a banking system with central bank. Banks optimize a portfolio of risky investments and riskless excess reserves according to their risk, return, and liquidity preferences. They are linked via interbank loans and face stochastic deposit supply. Comparing different interbank network structures, it is shown that money-centre networks are more stable than random networks. Evidence is provided that the central bank stabilizes interbank markets in the short run only. Systemic risk via contagion is compared with common shocks and it is shown that both forms of systemic risk require different optimal policy responses.},

We find that return predictability to central industries from their related (=customer and supplier) industries is substantially stronger than that to peripheral industries from their related industries. Long-short portfolios of central industries yield risk-adjusted returns of 7.0\% to 7.9\% per annum, which are 3.6\% to 5.3\% higher than those of peripheral industries. To explain this finding, we argue that investors who invest in central industries need to process more complicated information about related industries, making the prices of central industries slower to incorporate all the information. We find that sell-side analysts of central industries also face more complicated information about related industries, as their earnings forecast revisions of related industries predict their future revisions of central industries more strongly. In addition, we present evidence that our finding is not explained by existing anomalies.},

Empirical results confirm previous findings that there is a large contemporaneous relation, together with asymmetric lead-lag behaviour between the cash and futures markets. There is evidence that the futures lead the cash index returns, by responding more rapidly to economic events than stock prices. This asymmetric lead-lag relation can be attributed to the predictive power of futures returns, supporting the price discovery hypothesis that new market information is disseminated faster in the futures market compared to the stock market. After examining whether daily volatility in futures prices has systematically lead daily volatility in the cash index, the results provide a weak indication that cash volatility spills some information in the futures market volatility in the FTSE/ASE-20 market. In the FTSE/ASE Mid-40 market, the results indicate that there are robust volatility spillovers from the futures to the cash market, which imply that the futures market can be used as a price discovery vehicle.},

These return reversals are driven by order imbalances and noninformational shocks. Consistent with reversals representing compensation for supplying liquidity, intra-industry reversals are stronger following aggregate market declines and volatile times, reflecting binding capital constraints and limited risk-bearing capacity of liquidity providers.},

On the other hand, a model based only on overall market betas would predict a higher correlation between GM and AT\&T than between GM and Ford. The author develops five clusters of stocks corresponding to major extra-market factors, monitoring the explanatory power of each cluster statistically to determine the point in the clustering process at which the value of a cluster as a descriptor of extra-market stock price movement peaks. The clustering process terminates when clusters begin to be diluted by irrelevant stocks--for example, at the point where food companies join the utilities cluster. The explanatory power of the resulting clusters for the evaluation of extra-market risk represents better than a 30 per cent improvement over the single-index model. The clusters embody important fundamental characteristics. The utilities cluster is dominated by interest rate sensitivity, while the cyclical cluster is strongly influenced by the economic outlook. Thus, although factor betas change over time, they are actually more stable than market betas. The multiple factor risk model can be applied to stock classification, portfolio optimization and performance measurement, where, for example, its use simply eliminates the pesky benchmark selection problem.},

perspective on sectoral interactions. I apply these tools to show how fluctuations
in aggregate economic activity can be obtained from independent shocks to individual
sectors. First, I characterize the network structure of input trade in the U.S. On the
demand side, a typical sector relies on a small number of key inputs and sectors are
homogeneous in this respect. However, in their role as input-suppliers sectors do differ:
many specialized input suppliers coexist alongside general purpose sectors functioning
as hubs to the economy. I then develop a model of intersectoral linkages that can reproduce 
these connectivity features. In a standard multisector setup, I use this model
to provide analytical expressions linking aggregate volatility to the network structure
of input trade. I show that the presence of sectoral hubs - by coupling production
decisions across sectors - leads to fluctuations in aggregates.},

The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers.},

	abstract = {In economics, the Cobb–Douglas production function is a particular functional form of the production function, widely used to represent the technological relationship between the amounts of two or more inputs, particularly physical capital and labor, and the amount of output that can be produced by those inputs. Sometimes the term has a more restricted meaning, requiring that the function display constant returns to scale (in which case  in the formula below). The Cobb-Douglas form was developed and tested against statistical evidence by Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas during 1927–1947.},

	abstract = {Researchers increasingly turn to counterfactual simulations to estimate the danger of contagion owing to exposures in the interbank loan market. This paper summarises the findings of such simulations, provides a critical assessment of the modelling assumptions on which they are based, and discusses their use in financial stability analysis. On the whole, such simulations suggest that contagious defaults are unlikely but cannot be fully ruled out, at least in some countries. If contagion does take place, then it could lead to the breakdown of a substantial fraction of the banking system, thus imposing high costs to society. However, when interpreting these results, one has to bear in mind the potential bias caused by the very strong assumptions underlying the simulations. Robustness tests indicate that the models might be able to correctly predict whether or not contagion could be an issue and, possibly, also identify banks whose failure could give rise to contagion. They are, however, less suited for stress testing or for the analysis of policy options in crises, primarily due to their lack of behavioural foundations.},
